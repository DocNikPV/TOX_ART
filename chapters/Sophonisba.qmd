title: "The death of Sophonisba" 
---

**Sophonisba** (ca. 225-203 BC) was a Carthaginian noblewoman whose destiny became entangled in the Second Punic War (218-201 BC) between Rome and Carthage. Married first to the Numidian leader Syphax, she persuaded him to abandon Rome, which led to his defeat. The Numidian king Masinissa then took her as his wife, provoking the anger of the Roman general Scipio Africanus, who demanded that Sophonisba be handed over as a captive. Unable to resist Scipio yet unwilling to see her humiliated, Masinissa sent her a cup of poison. Sophonisba accepted the death willingly, preserving her dignity and sparing her husband from disgrace. Her story soon entered Roman legend as a model of dignity and political tragedy, later inspiring Renaissance and Baroque painters.
